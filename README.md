Epicodus: Week7, Day4

Lesson

Let's make a site for sharing recipes.

As a contributor, I want to post new recipes, so that I can share them with others.

As a contributor, I want to tag my recipes, so that they are easier to find. (Hint: a recipe has many tags, and a tag has many recipes. Another hint: don't be afraid to create several actions for this: one page for creating tags, one page for creating recipes, one page for adding tags to a recipe.)

As a cook, I want to choose a tag and see what recipes have that tag.
